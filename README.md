# Caesar Cipher in Python

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Python project! This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm, allowing users to encode and decode messages with a specified shift. The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encrypt Messages:** Shift the letters in your message forward by a specified amount to encode it.
- **Decrypt Messages:** Shift the letters in your message backward by the same amount to decode it.
- **Interactive User Interface:** The script interacts with the user to get the input text, the shift amount, and whether they want to encode or decode the message.
- **Handles Non-alphabetic Characters:** The script preserves spaces and other non-alphabetic characters in the message.
- **Loop for Multiple Uses:** Users can encode or decode multiple messages in one session.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chhayanaut/Caesar_Cipher.py.git
   cd Caesar_Cipher.py
python caesar_cipher.py
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
5
The encoded text is mjqqt
